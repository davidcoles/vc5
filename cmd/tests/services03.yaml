    description: Custom health check for HTTPS - check port is open (SYN) but also run http check against port 80

    servers:
      - 10.1.3.100

        checks:
          - type: syn
          - type: http
            port: 80

## FIXME: this doesn't work as I would expect (run check against a different port to that of the service) - maybe a bug
#    policy:
#      http:
#        port: 8080
